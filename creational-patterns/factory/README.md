# Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method Pattern provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It helps decouple the instantiation process from client code, making the system more flexible and easier to extend.

## Intent

The intent of the Factory Method Pattern is to:

- Define an interface for creating objects while allowing subclasses to change the actual object being created.
- Encourage the use of a common interface or abstract class for creating objects, leaving instantiation details to subclasses.

## Structure

The key components of the Factory Method Pattern are:

- **Product**: Defines the interface of the objects that the factory method creates.
- **ConcreteProduct**: Implements the Product interface.
- **Creator**: Declares the factory method that returns an object of type Product.
- **ConcreteCreator**: Overrides the factory method to return an instance of ConcreteProduct.

## Example

Here is an example of the Factory Method Pattern implemented in [Your Programming Language]:

## Benefits

- Promotes loose coupling between the client code and the specific classes of the products created.
- Supports the Open/Closed Principle by allowing new product types without modifying existing code.
- Simplifies code maintenance and testing by promoting a consistent way to create objects.

## Drawbacks

- May require creating additional subclasses for each type of product, which can add complexity.
- Requires subclassing to vary the products, which can be restrictive in certain cases.

## Related Patterns

- The Abstract Factory pattern is often used with Factory Method to create families of related objects.
- The Prototype pattern provides an alternative to subclassing for creating objects when creating new instances is more complex or expensive.
