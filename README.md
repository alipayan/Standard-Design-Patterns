# Standard Design Patterns

Welcome to the **Standard Design Patterns** repository! This project aims to provide clear, concise examples of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns implemented in c# programming languages. These examples will help you understand and apply these fundamental design principles in your own projects.

## Introduction

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code. This repository includes examples of the 23 classic design patterns introduced by the "Gang of Four" (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides).

## Design Pattern Categories

The design patterns are divided into three categories:

### Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They make the creation process more adaptable and dynamic. Examples include:

- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Factory Method
- Prototype
- Singleton

### Structural Patterns

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. Examples include:

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They help in defining how objects interact and communicate with each other. Examples include:

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor
